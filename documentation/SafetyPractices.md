## Authentication and Authorization

### Current Implementation

The application implements a session-based authentication system with the following features:

- Session management using `express-session`
- Cookie-based authentication with configurable security settings
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Session timeout and automatic logout
- Role-based access control for administrative functions

### Industry Standards Compliance

- **Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, which is an industry standard for secure password storage.
- **Session Management**: Sessions are managed securely with configurable expiration times.
- **Cookie Security**: Cookies can be configured with secure, httpOnly, and sameSite attributes.

### Potential Improvements

1. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement MFA for additional security, especially for administrative accounts.
2. **OAuth Integration**: Add support for OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.) for simplified and secure authentication.
3. **JWT Implementation**: Consider implementing JWT for stateless authentication, which can be beneficial for scaling.
4. **Password Policies**: Enforce stronger password policies (complexity, rotation, history).
5. **Account Lockout**: Implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.

## Data Security

### Current Implementation

- Database credentials stored in configuration files
- PostgreSQL database with standard security settings
- Data validation on input

### Industry Standards Compliance

- **Input Validation**: The application validates user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Parameterized Queries**: SQL queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection.

### Potential Improvements

1. **Data Encryption**: Implement encryption for sensitive data at rest.
2. **Database Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connection management.
3. **Database User Permissions**: Ensure database users have minimal required permissions.
4. **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for database operations.
5. **Data Masking**: Implement data masking for sensitive information in logs and error messages.

## WebSocket Security

### Current Implementation

The application does not currently implement WebSockets, but if added in the future, the following considerations should be addressed:

### Industry Standards for WebSockets

- **Authentication**: WebSocket connections should require authentication.
- **Message Validation**: All WebSocket messages should be validated.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Connection Timeouts**: Set appropriate connection timeouts.

### Potential Improvements for WebSocket Implementation

1. **Secure WebSocket Protocol**: Use WSS (WebSocket Secure) instead of WS.
2. **Token-based Authentication**: Implement token-based authentication for WebSocket connections.
3. **Message Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive WebSocket messages.
4. **Connection Monitoring**: Monitor and log WebSocket connections and activities.

## File Upload Security

### Current Implementation

- File uploads are handled using multer
- File type validation based on MIME types
- File size limits are enforced
- Files are stored in configurable directories

### Industry Standards Compliance

- **File Type Validation**: The application validates file types to prevent malicious file uploads.
- **Size Limitations**: File size limits prevent denial of service attacks.
- **Storage Isolation**: Uploaded files are stored in dedicated directories.

### Potential Improvements

1. **Content Scanning**: Implement virus/malware scanning for uploaded files.
2. **File Sanitization**: Sanitize uploaded files to remove potentially harmful content.
3. **Metadata Stripping**: Remove metadata from uploaded files to prevent information leakage.
4. **CDN Integration**: Store and serve files through a CDN for improved security and performance.
5. **Temporary File Cleanup**: Ensure temporary files are properly cleaned up.

## API Security

### Current Implementation

- API routes are protected with authentication middleware
- Input validation for API requests
- CORS configuration to control access

### Industry Standards Compliance

- **Authentication**: APIs require authentication for protected resources.
- **CORS Configuration**: CORS is configured to restrict access to trusted origins.
- **Input Validation**: API inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks.

### Potential Improvements

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
2. **API Versioning**: Implement proper API versioning for better maintenance.
3. **Request Throttling**: Add throttling for sensitive operations.
4. **API Documentation**: Improve API documentation with security considerations.
5. **API Keys**: Implement API keys for external integrations.

## Configuration Management

### Current Implementation

- Configuration stored in config.ini file
- Sensitive values can be overridden via environment variables
- Path configurations for document storage

### Industry Standards Compliance

- **Configuration Separation**: Configuration is separated from code.
- **Environment-specific Configuration**: Different environments can have different configurations.

### Potential Improvements

1. **Secret Management**: Implement a dedicated secret management solution.
2. **Configuration Validation**: Validate configuration values on startup.
3. **Encrypted Configuration**: Encrypt sensitive configuration values.
4. **Configuration Documentation**: Improve documentation for configuration options.
5. **Default Security**: Ensure default configuration values are secure.

## Potential Security Improvements

### High Priority

1. **Security Headers**: Implement security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.).
2. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Enforce HTTPS for all connections.
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan and update dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
4. **Input Sanitization**: Enhance input sanitization across the application.
5. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to prevent information disclosure.

### Medium Priority

1. **Security Logging**: Implement comprehensive security logging.
2. **User Activity Monitoring**: Monitor and alert on suspicious user activities.
3. **Session Management Improvements**: Enhance session management with features like concurrent session control.
4. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations.
5. **Content Security Policy**: Implement a strict Content Security Policy.

### Low Priority

1. **Security Documentation**: Improve security documentation for developers.
2. **Security Training**: Provide security training for development team.
3. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing.
4. **Security Code Reviews**: Implement security-focused code reviews.
5. **Bug Bounty Program**: Consider implementing a bug bounty program.

## Compliance Considerations

Depending on your application's use case and the data it handles, you may need to comply with various regulations:

### GDPR Compliance

If handling EU citizens' data:

- Implement data subject access rights (export, delete)
- Obtain and manage consent
- Implement data minimization practices
- Document data processing activities

### HIPAA Compliance

If handling healthcare data:

- Implement stricter access controls
- Enhance audit logging
- Implement data encryption at rest and in transit
- Conduct regular risk assessments

### PCI DSS Compliance

If handling payment card data:

- Implement cardholder data security measures
- Enhance network security
- Implement stronger access control measures
- Conduct regular security testing

## Known Bugs and Issues

The following are known security-related bugs and issues that should be addressed:

1. **Document Path Handling**: Inconsistent document path handling can lead to file access issues.
2. **Error Message Exposure**: Some error messages may expose sensitive information.
3. **Session Timeout Handling**: Improve handling of session timeouts and renewals.
4. **Database Connection Management**: Optimize database connection handling to prevent connection leaks.
5. **File Upload Validation**: Enhance file upload validation to prevent bypass techniques.

## Security Monitoring and Response

### Current Implementation

- Basic error logging
- Application monitoring

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Security Monitoring**: Implement dedicated security monitoring.
2. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and document an incident response plan.
