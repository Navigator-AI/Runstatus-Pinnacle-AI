# MCP Chat Integration Tracker

## Goal
Enable sending messages to the AI model when in MCP mode, getting streaming responses back, and saving messages to the database as with normal chat.

## Current Status
- MCP toggle exists in UI and can establish connection to MCP server
- Client ID is successfully obtained via SSE connection
- ✅ Added backend proxy endpoint for MCP chat interactions
- ✅ Added frontend service for MCP chat
- ✅ Modified Chatbot.tsx to handle regular chat when MCP is enabled
- ✅ Messages now flow to the selected AI model when MCP is active
- ✅ Added required dependencies (eventsource)
- ✅ Fixed duplicate connection issues and reconnection loops
- ✅ Improved client ID handling and connection management
- ✅ Separated agent toggle from MCP toggle for better control
- ✅ Simplified MCP integration by removing unnecessary components
- ✅ Streamlined notifications to only show essential client ID message
- ✅ Removed unnecessary components (MCPDiagnosticsButton, MCPToolResult, etc.)
- ✅ Simplified the ai.js backend route
- ✅ Created a dedicated notification panel for MCP status messages
- ✅ Removed MCP messages from the main chat window

## Implementation Summary

We've implemented the following components to enable AI chat in MCP mode:

### Backend

1. Simplified the `/api/ai.js` route to only handle basic chat functionality:
   - Removed complex MCP command generation and analysis
   - Kept only the essential functionality for chat messages
   - Added direct response format for the frontend

2. Updated the `/api/mcp/chat` endpoint to:
   - Support direct chat without going through the MCP agent
   - Validate client ID and server info
   - Forward messages to Ollama service for processing
   - Return responses to the frontend

### Frontend

1. Created a new `mcpChatService.ts` service that:
   - Provides a similar API to the existing `aiChatService`
   - Includes functions for both streaming and non-streaming requests
   - Handles SSE connections for streaming responses
   - Properly manages abort controllers for cancellation

2. Added a new notification system:
   - Created a dedicated `MCPNotifications` component for displaying status updates
   - Modified `MCPAgentContext` to store notifications separately from chat messages
   - Added a notification bell icon in the UI header for easy access
   - Implemented filtering to show only essential notifications

3. Simplified the codebase by removing unnecessary components:
   - Removed `MCPDiagnosticsButton.tsx`
   - Removed `MCPToolResult.tsx`
   - Removed `MCPCommandApproval.tsx`
   - Removed `MCPAgentControls.tsx`

4. Updated `Chatbot.tsx` to:
   - Check if MCP is enabled but agent is disabled
   - Use the MCP chat service instead of the regular AI chat service
   - Pass the client ID and server info to the MCP chat endpoint
   - Maintain the same streaming UI experience
   - Save messages to the database as usual
   - Keep the main chat window clean of connection messages

## Simplified Workflow

1. User toggles MCP mode in the UI
2. System connects to MCP server and obtains client ID
3. A notification appears in the notification panel showing the client ID and connection status
4. User can immediately start chatting with the AI model
5. Messages are sent to the AI model with the MCP client ID
6. Responses stream back just like in normal chat mode
7. All chat history is saved to the database
8. Connection errors and status updates appear in the notification panel instead of the main chat

## Conclusion

We've successfully streamlined the MCP integration to focus on the core functionality needed:

1. **Simplified Architecture**:
   - Removed complex agent functionality and replaced it with direct chat
   - Deleted unnecessary components to reduce code complexity
   - Created a dedicated notification system for MCP status updates

2. **Better User Experience**:
   - Removed all notifications from the main chat window
   - Created a clean notification panel for connection status
   - Maintained the same chat experience when using MCP
   - Added a notification bell icon for easy access to MCP status

3. **Easier Maintenance**:
   - Reduced code complexity by removing unused components
   - Simplified the AI endpoint to only handle chat functionality
   - Made error handling more straightforward
   - Removed complex command generation and approval workflow
   - Separated notification logic from chat message handling

The system now allows users to connect to MCP, obtain a client ID, and chat with AI models as usual, without any connection messages interrupting the chat flow.

## Integration Steps

### 1. Modify Message Handling in Chatbot.tsx
- ✅ Update `handleSendMessage` function to properly route messages when MCP is enabled
- ✅ Ensure messages still go to the selected AI model even when MCP is active
- ✅ Maintain the existing message formatting and database storage

### 2. Create Backend Proxy for MCP
- ✅ Implement a proxy endpoint in the backend (e.g., `/api/mcp/chat`)
- ✅ Route messages through this endpoint to maintain consistency with existing chat API
- ✅ Pass client ID in requests to track MCP session

### 3. Implement Streaming Response Handling
- ✅ Ensure the SSE connection handles AI responses in addition to tool outputs
- ✅ Maintain the same streaming mechanism used in normal chat mode
- ✅ Update the frontend to correctly display streaming responses in MCP mode

### 4. Update Database Storage Logic
- ✅ Modify message storage to include MCP metadata (e.g., client ID)
- ✅ Ensure chat history retrieval works correctly with MCP messages
- ✅ Maintain consistency in message format between MCP and normal chat

### 5. Enhance MCPContext to Track Message State
- ✅ Update the context to track when messages are being processed
- ✅ Add state for whether a response is streaming 
- ✅ Connect this state to the UI loading indicators

### 6. Fix Connection Issues
- ✅ Prevent duplicate connection attempts
- ✅ Improve client ID handling and storage
- ✅ Make connection messages more user-friendly
- ✅ Bypass AI agent for normal chat when using MCP

### 7. Testing Plan
- Test sending messages in MCP mode
- Verify responses stream correctly
- Confirm messages are saved to the database
- Check that chat history loads properly
