## Known Issues

- [x] Identified excessive WebSocket connections issue (user-338a1f7e has 499+ connections)
  - Root causes:
    - React StrictMode causing double mounting of components in development mode
    - Missing heartbeat mechanism to keep connections alive
    - Connections not properly closed when navigating between pages
    - Aggressive reconnection logic creating duplicate connections
    - Polling in WebSocket test page creating additional load
  - Implemented fixes:
    - [x] Removed React StrictMode to prevent double mounting of components
    - [x] Implemented singleton pattern for WebSocket connections using global variables
    - [x] Added client-side heartbeat mechanism in WebSocketContext.tsx
    - [x] Added server-side ping/pong mechanism in server.js
    - [x] Implemented proper connection cleanup on unmount and page navigation
    - [x] Optimized reconnection logic with better error handling
    - [x] Removed WebSocket test page and related components (not needed for production)
    - [x] Improved WebSocketStatus component to be more subtle and user-friendly
    - [x] Added dedicated Debugging Settings page for monitoring WebSocket connections

- [x] WebSocket connection showing as disconnected in debug settings and red/inactive on home page
  - Root causes:
    - Reconnection logic not aggressive enough
    - Heartbeat mechanism not properly detecting and handling dead connections
    - WebSocket connection not being properly established on page navigation
  - Implemented fixes:
    - [x] Removed WebSocket status indicator from homepage for cleaner UI
    - [x] Improved WebSocket connection handling with better state management
    - [x] Enhanced heartbeat mechanism to detect and recover from dead connections
    - [x] Added manual reconnect button in debugging settings
    - [x] Increased maximum reconnection attempts from 5 to 10
    - [x] Improved error handling and connection state tracking
    - [x] Added more detailed logging for connection issues

- [x] Excessive WebSocket connections (250+ connections for a single user)
  - Root causes:
    - Multiple WebSocketProvider instances creating separate connections
    - No limit on the number of connections per user on the server side
    - React component remounting creating new connections
  - Implemented fixes:
    - [x] Added a primary provider concept to ensure only one provider creates connections
    - [x] Limited connections per user to 3 on the server side
    - [x] Added automatic cleanup of old connections when new ones are established
    - [x] Improved heartbeat mechanism to only run for the primary provider
    - [x] Added connection timestamp tracking for better connection management

- [x] WebSocket connection failing during document uploads and processing
  - Root causes:
    - Connection not maintained during file uploads
    - No message queuing for disconnected users
    - Multiple notifications for the same document status
    - Lack of detailed user feedback during document processing
    - Authentication issues with WebSocket connections
  - Implemented fixes:
    - [x] Added localStorage flag to indicate when file upload is in progress
    - [x] Increased heartbeat frequency during file uploads
    - [x] Implemented message queuing for disconnected users
    - [x] Added deduplication of queued messages to prevent duplicates
    - [x] Improved retry logic for WebSocket broadcasts with increasing delays
    - [x] Enhanced document processing messages to provide better user feedback
    - [x] Added checks to prevent duplicate "document processed" notifications
    - [x] Improved the document processing flow with clearer status updates
    - [x] Added fallback polling that always runs alongside WebSocket updates
    - [x] Enhanced WebSocket authentication to use actual user ID from session store
    - [x] Added connection verification with ping/pong mechanism
    - [x] Implemented more aggressive reconnection strategy for first few attempts
    - [x] Added localStorage flags to track connection state across page refreshes
    - [x] Added document processing flag to increase heartbeat frequency during processing
    - [x] Improved heartbeat mechanism to detect and recover from dead connections
    - [x] Added timeout detection for ping/pong responses to detect dead connections

## Document Processing Flow Improvements

- [x] Enhanced document processing user experience
  - [x] Improved initial upload message: "I've received your document and started uploading it..."
  - [x] Added detailed processing message: "Your document has been uploaded successfully. Now I'm extracting text, chunking the content..."
  - [x] Added specific embedding phase message: "Text extraction and chunking complete! Now generating embeddings..."
  - [x] Improved success message: "Your document has been fully processed and is ready for questions!"
  - [x] Consolidated notifications into a single workflow with clear status updates
  - [x] Prevented duplicate success messages when document processing completes
  - [x] Fixed issue with multiple identical "document processed" notifications
    - [x] Added more comprehensive checks to prevent duplicate notifications
    - [x] Improved coordination between different notification mechanisms
