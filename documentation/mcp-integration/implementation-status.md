## Detailed Implementation Status

### Database Schema
**Status: Complete** ‚úÖ

The database schema for MCP integration includes two main tables:

The API routes for MCP integration are implemented in `src/routes/mcp.js` and include:
- MCP configuration retrieval
- SSH configuration management
- MCP server configuration management
- Connection testing and status reporting
- MCP installation via SSH
- Remote filesystem operations
- Tool discovery and execution

The routes are correctly implemented with proper authentication middleware and error handling.

### Frontend Components

#### MCP Context
**Status: Complete** ‚úÖ

Implementation file: `client/src/components/settings/MCPSettings.tsx`

#### SSH Configuration Components
**Status: Complete** ‚úÖ

Components for managing SSH configurations:
- SSH configuration form
- SSH configuration list
- Secure credential handling

Implementation files:
- `client/src/components/settings/SSHConfigForm.tsx`
- `client/src/components/settings/SSHConfigList.tsx`

#### MCP Installation Components
**Status: Complete** ‚úÖ

Components for the MCP installation process:
- Multi-step installation wizard
- Remote filesystem browsing
- Directory selection
- Installation progress tracking

Implementation files:
- `client/src/pages/MCPInstall.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/MCPManualInstall.tsx`
- `client/src/components/ssh/RemoteFilesystemExplorer.tsx`
- `client/src/components/ssh/DirectoryBrowser.tsx`
- `client/src/components/ssh/FileSystemItem.tsx`

#### MCP Chat Integration Components
**Status: Partially Complete** üîÑ

Components for MCP integration in the chat interface:
- Command approval UI (complete)
- Result display (in progress)

Implementation files:
- `client/src/components/chat/MCPCommandApproval.tsx` (complete)
- `client/src/components/chat/MCPToolResult.tsx` (in progress)

### Chat Interface Integration
**Status: In Progress** üîÑ

Integration of MCP with the chat interface:
- Add MCP toggle (pending)
- Implement command extraction (in progress)
- Connect command approval workflow (in progress)
- Implement result display (in progress)

### Security Audit and Testing
**Status: Pending** ‚ùå

A comprehensive security audit and testing of the MCP integration is pending. This will include:
- SSH credential handling review
- MCP connection security review
- Injection vulnerability checks
- User acceptance testing

## Next Steps

1. Complete the chat interface integration:
   - Implement MCP toggle in chat header
   - Connect command approval component to chat interface
   - Implement command extraction from AI responses
   - Complete result display component

2. Add WebSocket integration for real-time updates:
   - Implement WebSocket handlers for MCP events
   - Connect frontend components to WebSocket events
   - Add real-time status updates

3. Perform security audit and testing:
   - Review SSH credential handling
   - Check for possible injection vulnerabilities
   - Test all installation flows
   - Test command execution and approval

4. Create documentation:
   - User documentation for MCP features
   - Administrator documentation for MCP setup
   - Developer documentation for MCP integration
   - Troubleshooting guides

5. Final integration with main application:
   - Update AI prompt templates
   - Implement MCP command detection
   - Add MCP status to chat context

## Technical Details

### SSH Authentication Security
- Password encryption uses AES-256-GCM
- Private keys are handled securely
- All credentials are validated server-side

### MCP Connection Management
- Persistent SSE connection to the MCP server
- Connection status monitoring
- Automatic reconnection

### Command Approval Security
- All commands require explicit user approval
- UI clearly shows commands to be executed
- Users can modify or reject commands

### Error Handling Strategy
- Clear error messages for connection issues
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful fallbacks when MCP is unavailable

## Conclusion
The MCP integration implementation is progressing well with most of the core components already completed. The remaining work focuses on chat interface integration and final security measures. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for the remaining tasks.
